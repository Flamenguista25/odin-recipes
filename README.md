I'm writing this after having done the project...
-I learned a lot doing this project. In a random order some things that I learned are:
-Don't put paragraphs together with ordered lists or undordered
-Keep headings out of the brackets for lists 
-I really improved my Command Line abilities, moving between folders, renaming files, moving files to other folders, adding images and links, etc. This was one of the greatest benefits.
-I still need to get better at understanding Git. I didn't really stage or commit anything during the project, and it would have felt like an interruption to do that during my process of fixing solutions. But that is why I need to work on that more, so that it becomes second nature.
-All in all I was able to fix errors pretty intuitively so that made me happy. Doing all the practice and seeing what went wrong and why, and fixing the problems really helped me understand and interiorize the theory that I've learned so far in The Odin Project.
-I'm very happy!
